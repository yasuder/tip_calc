## Notes

Some challenges that I encountered while developing the application include making the code concise and enabling form input data retention for the subtotal, custom tip % and such. Debugging my code proved to be especially difficult and tedious with this application because of the constant rotation between updating the code, uploading it to the server, then updating the application on my browser with new inputs. However, I am satisfied with the end result, as it has helped to refresh my fluency with web development, specifically PHP.
